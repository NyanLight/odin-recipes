    <p><em>The Perfect Coconut Cake Recipe with Creamy Sweet Cream Cheese Frosting</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups Cake Flour</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cup Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Baking Powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup Dry Pudding Mix coconut or vanilla</li>
        <li>1 cup Butter cut into cubes, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup Canned Unsweetened Coconut Milk full-fat</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Buttermilk</li>
        <li>4 Egg Whites</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li> - 2 teaspoons Coconut Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a standing mixer, stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and pudding mix. </li>
        <li>Beat the butter into the flour mixture, one cube at a time. Continue to beat until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together coconut milk, buttermilk, egg whites, egg, and coconut extract. Add the ½ of the egg-milk mixture and beat the batter is light and fluffy. Add remaining egg-milk mixture and mix just until combined. Take a spatula and scrape the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Spread into greased pans and smooth tops with a spatula. Use two 9-inch pans or three 8-inch cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18-22 minutes, depending on the depth of pans. If the cake layers are thin, they will cook for less time than the thicker layers. This time is for three thin 8-inch layers. Check for doneness by placing a cake tester or toothpick in center of the cake.        </li>
        <li>Let cakes cool. Run a knife around edge of cake pan and flip over</li>
        <li>To make simple syrup: heat water and sugar in a small pan over medium heat. Let it come to a simmer. Once the sugar is completely dissolved and is clear, remove from heat. Let cool. Brush simple syrup over cake layers.        </li>
    </ol>
